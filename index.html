			<p>Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be&hellip; Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. How much did you make me? I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Shut up and get to the point!</p>

				<h2>Anthology of Interest II</h2>
				<p>Why did you bring us here? I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Bite my shiny metal ass. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!</p>
				
				<h2>The Why of Fry</h2>
				
				<p>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Shut up and get to the point!</li>
					<li>Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates&hellip; PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</li>
					<li>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>When Aliens Attack</h3>
				
				<p>Your best is an idiot! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Really?! It must be wonderful. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Hey, guess what you're accessories to.</p>
				
				<h4>My Three Suns</h4>
				
				<p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Bender, we're trying our best. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>It doesn't look so shiny to me.</li>
					<li>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</li>
					<li>Why did you bring us here?</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h5>The Day The Earth Stood Stupid</h5>
				
				<p>No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Anyone who laughs is a communist! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.</p>
